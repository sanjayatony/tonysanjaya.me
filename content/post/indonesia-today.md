I see this country as I see Gotham. Where everything is corrupt. You need insiders to make things work, money to make things faster, etc.

As an ordinary citizen who has no connections to insiders and doesn’t have much money to bribe, I am quite happy with what has happened lately.

I see this situation as the 4th Nolan’s Batman. Where white knights have shown themselves throughout this country.

But I keep myself from being to excited for anything. There always some plot twist at the end.
